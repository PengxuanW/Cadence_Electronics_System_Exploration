# Electronics_System_SubSystem_Exploration

A co-op project with Cadence electronics, aims to detect matched sub-systems as part of a large scale electronics system. Example: Checking and locating if mesh of connection exists in IC board and PCB systems. In order to represent a real-world electronics sytem, I proposed an abstraction view that used a graph structure of nodes and edges as the physical components and wire connections. With a graph topology, we applied different algorithms such as a modified BFS, Graph NN, and decision trees to detect the existence of sub-systems / sub-graphs. We used graph algorithms such as the "infamous" Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algorithms to extract useful features in different graphs. We also experimented with advanced graph theory ideas such as 1. Kőnig’s theorem to detect matchings (a graph feature), 2. chordal graphs to define a specific lexicographicBFS ordering as a unique feature, and 3. graph centrality and k-core numbers to detect a densely connected component.
